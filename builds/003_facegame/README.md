FaceGame
A game about faces

FaceGame (placeholder name) is a name learning game. The goal is to match the face to the correct name. This is a web application that will be designed mobile-first. The game will have two modes. An easy mode that will pull first names, and a hard mode that will pull last names. The game will have user profiles with game history data and a leaderboard.

How it works: An image appears in the middle. One name appears above the image and another below it. The user then has to flick the image up or down to match the image with the correct name. The user will gain a point for each correct answer, and lose one point for incorrect answers. There will also be a loss of 1 point per second to encourage speed. The user will start with 10 points, and lose if the points reach 0. Then the game will stop and show the userâ€™s highest score achieved.

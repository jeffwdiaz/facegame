# Data Chunker

A utility tool for efficiently chunking and processing large datasets into manageable pieces.

## Overview

The Data Chunker is designed to handle large datasets by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This is particularly useful for:

- Processing large files that exceed memory limits
- Batch processing of data
- Parallel processing of data segments
- Memory-efficient data handling

## Features

- **Configurable Chunk Size**: Define the size of each data chunk
- **Flexible Input Formats**: Support for various data formats
- **Memory Efficient**: Process data in chunks to minimize memory usage
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor chunking progress
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Installation

```bash
# Installation instructions will be added once the project is set up

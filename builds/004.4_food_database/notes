# Project Structure

1. **`models/`**
   - This directory contains the core data structures and schemas for your documents
   - Files typically include:
     - Document schemas (e.g., `user.schema.ts`, `product.schema.ts`)
     - Model classes that represent your database entities
     - Validation rules and constraints
     - Example: A user model might define fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, and their types
   - These files define the structure and rules for your documents

2. **`repositories/`**
   - This is where all direct database interactions happen
   - Files typically include:
     - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
     - Query builders
     - Database connection management
     - Example: `user.repository.ts` might contain methods like:
       ```typescript
       findById(id: string)
       create(user: User)
       update(id: string, data: Partial<User>)
       delete(id: string)
       ```
   - These files abstract away the database implementation details

3. **`services/`**
   - Contains business logic and complex operations
   - Files typically include:
     - Business rules and validations
     - Complex data processing
     - Integration with other services
     - Example: `user.service.ts` might contain methods like:
       ```typescript
       registerUser(userData: UserInput)
       updateUserProfile(userId: string, profileData: ProfileData)
       handleUserDeletion(userId: string)
       ```
   - These files implement the business requirements and orchestrate operations

4. **`types/`**
   - Contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
   - Files typically include:
     - Type definitions for database entities
     - Input/output types for API endpoints
     - Shared type definitions
     - Example: `user.types.ts` might contain:
       ```typescript
       interface User {
         id: string;
         name: string;
         email: string;
         createdAt: Date;
       }
       
       type UserInput = Omit<User, 'id' | 'createdAt'>;
       ```
   - These files ensure type safety across your application

5. **`utils/`**
   - Contains helper functions and utilities
   - Files typically include:
     - Database connection utilities
     - Query builders
     - Data transformation functions
     - Error handling utilities
     - Example: `db.utils.ts` might contain:
       ```typescript
       createDatabaseConnection()
       buildQuery(filter: FilterOptions)
       handleDatabaseError(error: Error)
       ```
   - These files provide reusable functionality across the database layer

**Typical File Flow:**
1. A request comes in through an API endpoint
2. The service layer (`services/`) receives the request
3. The service uses the repository layer (`repositories/`) to interact with the database
4. The repository uses models (`models/`) to validate and structure the data
5. Types (`types/`) ensure type safety throughout the process
6. Utilities (`utils/`) provide helper functions where needed

This structure follows the separation of concerns principle:
- Models define what the data looks like
- Repositories handle how to store/retrieve data
- Services implement what to do with the data
- Types ensure type safety
- Utils provide reusable functionality

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these folders or provide more concrete examples for your use case?

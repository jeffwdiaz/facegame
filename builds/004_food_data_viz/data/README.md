## Data Sources

1. **Poore & Nemecek (2018) - Reducing food's environmental impacts through producers and consumers**
   - Source: Science journal supplementary data
   - Date Retrieved: 2024-04-06
   - Description: Comprehensive meta-analysis of food environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water use across different food types and production systems
   - DOI: 10.1126/science.aaq0216
   - File: 1-s2.0-S0308521X18305675-mmc1.docx

## Data Processing Plan

1. **Initial Processing Steps**:
   - Convert Word document to CSV format
   - Extract relevant columns for our analysis:
     - Food type/category
     - Greenhouse gas emissions (kg CO2e)
     - Land use (m²)
     - Water use (liters)
   - Standardize units and naming conventions
   - Create separate files for:
     - Beef data
     - Plant-based alternatives

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Check for missing values
   - Verify unit consistency
   - Cross-reference with original publication
   - Document any assumptions or conversions made

3. **Storage**:
   - Processed data will be stored in `processed/` directory
   - Final data will be loaded into SQLite database

## Data Format

All processed data files will:
- Be in CSV format
- Include headers
- Use consistent units:
  - Greenhouse gas emissions: kg CO2e per kg of product
  - Land use: square meters per kg of product
  - Water use: liters per kg of product
- Include source attribution
- Include processing date
- Include any relevant notes about data transformations

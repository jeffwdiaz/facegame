# Problem Statement
Our society is facing a growing crisis of division and distrust, fueled in part by the emotionally charged content that dominates our news landscape. Millennials and older Americans, who are active participants in our democracy, are constantly bombarded with news that evokes anger, fear, hatred, and outrage. This constant barrage of negativity makes it difficult for them to form balanced, well-informed opinions and engage in constructive dialogue. The potential impact of addressing this problem is huge. By providing access to neutral, emotion-free news, we can promote a more informed and rational public discourse, foster greater understanding and empathy between different groups, and ultimately strengthen our democracy.

# Project Outline
A website/tool that scrape news content from a predetermined list of sources. The website will have a few choices to start of the type of news. For example: it will have *Political*, *Financial*, *World*, etc. At first it will only have one option (Political). After the user chooses the category, then the tool will scrape predetermined sites and will pick the 10 most popular news stories and put them into a JSON file. News source list will consist of 10 that lean politically left, 10 that lean politically right, and 10 that lean to the center. This list will be in a JSON file. It will then take the first and most popular story and search the 30 predetermined sites for articles about this story. It will run these articles through the *depolarizer*. It will then output the story created from the depolarizer. It will then do the same with the rest of the stories.

# Workflow
1. User Selection and Initialization
   - User selects news category (initially only Political)
   - System validates category selection
   - Initialize scraping session with timestamp

2. Source Validation and Preparation
   - Load and validate news source configuration
   - Check source availability and health
   - Rotate sources if needed (prevent overuse)
   - Initialize rate limiting and quotas

3. Content Collection
   - Scan configured websites in parallel
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Validate and clean scraped content
   - Store raw articles in temporary storage

4. Story Processing
   - Cluster similar articles into stories
   - Calculate story popularity scores
   - Apply source diversity requirements
   - Select top 10 stories meeting criteria

5. Deep Content Analysis
   For each selected story:
   - Search all sources for related content
   - Validate content relevance
   - Group articles by perspective (left/center/right)
   - Extract key facts and claims

6. Depolarization Process
   For each story:
   - Run sentiment analysis on all articles
   - Identify and remove emotionally charged language
   - Cross-reference facts across sources
   - Generate neutral summary
   - Add source attribution

7. Quality Control
   - Validate depolarized content
   - Check for factual accuracy
   - Ensure balanced representation
   - Verify readability and clarity

8. Output Generation
   - Format final content
   - Add metadata and timestamps
   - Generate JSON output
   - Update user interface

9. Monitoring and Feedback
   - Log processing metrics
   - Track source performance
   - Collect user feedback
   - Update source reliability scores

10. Error Handling and Recovery
    - If any step fails:
      - Log error details
      - Attempt recovery procedures
      - Fall back to cached content if available
      - Notify system administrators if critical

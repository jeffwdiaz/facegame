# Data Vectorization Tool

A powerful and efficient tool for converting various types of data into vector representations, enabling machine learning and data analysis applications, particularly for Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic search systems.

## Overview

This tool provides a robust framework for transforming different data types (text, images, audio, etc.) into numerical vector representations (embeddings). These embeddings are essential for:

- **LLM Applications**
  - Creating embeddings for semantic search
  - Building vector databases for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  - Enabling similarity-based retrieval for LLM context windows
  - Supporting hybrid search systems combining vector and keyword search

- **Machine Learning Tasks**
  - Similarity search
  - Clustering
  - Classification
  - Dimensionality reduction

## Features

- **LLM-Optimized Vectorization**
  - Text embedding generation compatible with major LLM frameworks
  - Support for popular embedding models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings, Sentence Transformers)
  - Integration with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus)
  - Batch processing for efficient large-scale embedding generation

- **Multiple Data Type Support**
  - Text vectorization (documents, sentences, paragraphs)
  - Image vectorization
  - Audio vectorization
  - Custom data type support

- **Flexible Embedding Models**
  - Pre-trained models support (BERT, GPT, etc.)
  - Custom model integration
  - Multiple embedding dimensions
  - Model fine-tuning capabilities

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Batch processing
  - GPU acceleration
  - Memory-efficient operations
  - Distributed processing support

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vectorizer.git
cd vectorizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from vectorizer import Vectorizer

# Initialize the vectorizer
vectorizer = Vectorizer(model_type="text")

# Convert data to vectors
vectors = vectorizer.transform(["Sample text 1", "Sample text 2"])
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Custom model configuration
vectorizer = Vectorizer(
    model_type="text",
    model_name="custom-model",
    embedding_dim=512,
    batch_size=32
)

# Process large datasets
vectors = vectorizer.transform_batch(large_dataset)
```

## Configuration

The tool can be configured through a configuration file or programmatically:

```python
config = {
    "model_type": "text",
    "model_name": "bert-base-uncased",
    "batch_size": 32,
    "device": "cuda"  # or "cpu"
}
```

## API Reference

### Vectorizer Class

- `__init__(self, model_type: str, **kwargs)`
  - Initialize the vectorizer with specified model type and configuration

- `transform(self, data: Union[str, List[str]]) -> np.ndarray`
  - Convert input data to vector representations

- `transform_batch(self, data: List[Any], batch_size: int = 32) -> np.ndarray`
  - Process large datasets in batches
